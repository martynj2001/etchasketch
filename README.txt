Etch-a-Sketch Project

Simple HTML/CSS & JavaScript/JQuery project to produce an etch a sketch. Change modes to add random colours to blocks. Reset Grid to any size between 0 - 100.

Resizing if c=blocks to compensate for grids ob=ver 25 blocks is rudimentary and needs refining (margin sizes screw it up).
